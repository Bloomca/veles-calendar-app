## Veles Calendar App

- [application](https://bloomca.github.io/veles-calendar-app/)

This is a companion app for the [Veles](https://github.com/bloomca/veles) library. The idea of the library is to provide a composable UI library which allows for very performant interactive interfaces, and this application is designed to push it to the limits, find bugs, and ideally find areas where the performance can be improved even further.

The application is currently under development, here are the things which will be implemented:

- completing tasks
- labels
- all projects view
- live filters (show completed tasks, include/exclude specific sections/projects, specific date ranges, labels)
- drag and drop
- task editor, for creating tasks and editing
